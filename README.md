# AES-Encryption-Program
A student equivalent capstone project to demonstrate working knowledge of the AES algorithm and associated knowledge of cryptography.
AES uses the EXOR, transposition, diffusion, and Galois field theory principles to encrypt data in a reversable format.
This project demonstrates use of bit-masking, array manipulation, pointer manipulation, field theory operations, and appropriate coding practices. 

Additionally, this project was undertaken with no prior knowledge of Group theory (a fundemental aspect of understanding Galois finite fields) and thus demonstrates an ability to learn and produce work on a short timeline of 10 weeks.
